## Project Description
BlockID is a decentralized digital identity management system built on Ethereum.  
It allows users to **register**, **update**, and **verify** their blockchain-based identities in a transparent and tamper-proof way.

## Project Vision
To empower individuals to control their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities or third-party platforms.

## Key Features
- **Identity Registration:** Users can create a verified blockchain identity.
- **Identity Update:** Modify personal details securely at any time.
- **Data Transparency:** Identity data is immutable and verifiable on-chain.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized authentication (DID standards).
- Reputation and trust scoring system.
- Optional off-chain data storage using IPFS.
- Integration with Web3 applications and DAO membership systems.
